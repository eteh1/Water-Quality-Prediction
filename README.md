# Water Quality Prediction

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting water quality parameters based on various physicochemical characteristics. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting water quality indicators such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and other chemical constituents.

## Features
The dataset includes the following water quality parameters:
- **pH** – Acidity/alkalinity of water
- **EC (Electrical Conductivity)** – Measures the ability of water to conduct electricity, indicating dissolved salts
- **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)** – The total amount of dissolved substances in water
- **NO₃ (Nitrate)** – Presence of nitrates, an indicator of pollution from fertilizers and waste
- **Cl (Chloride)** – A measure of chloride ion concentration
- **SO₄ (Sulfate)** – Presence of sulfate ions in water
- **TA (Total Alkalinity)** – The water's ability to neutralize acids
- **TH (Total Hardness)** – Total concentration of calcium and magnesium ions
- **Ca (Calcium)** – Calcium ion concentration
- **Mg (Magnesium)** – Magnesium ion concentration
- **Na (Sodium)** – Sodium ion concentration
- **K (Potassium)** – Potassium ion concentration
- **Fe (Iron)** – Presence of iron in water

## Project Objectives
- Collect and preprocess water quality data
- Develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques
- Evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data
- Provide insights into the factors influencing water quality

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks (depending on data performance)

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering and selection
- Data normalization and scaling
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Model Training & Evaluation
- Training multiple models and selecting the best-performing one
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE, R² Score, MAE
